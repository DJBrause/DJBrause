👋 Hey there! I'm Pawel, a Python enthusiast on a mission to automate everything! 💻 When I'm not crafting elegant code or diving into the depths of Python libraries, you can find me exploring new ways to streamline processes and enhance efficiency through automation.

🐍 Python Developer | Automation Enthusiast | Code Explorer

🔧 Currently tinkering with:
- Python scripts for automation
- Exploring PyAutoGUI for GUI automation
- Delving into MediaPipe for computer vision applications
- Leveraging EasyOCR for optical character recognition
- Exploring data science and machine learning concepts

I'm open for collaboration on making cool code, one line of code at a time! 🚀
